# [brainf*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
I just watched [TheHappieCat](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHappieCat)'s [brainf\*ck video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3C200nCwpk) and i felt brainf\*ck isnt that hard to **UNDERSTAND** how it works, but it's still pretty hard to code with no cap. overall the language is a piece of art 10/10 would not work with it again. :)

so i printed my name in brainf*ck

## ignore whatever is below this i wanna make a simple explanation of how this works later.
